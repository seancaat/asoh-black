  <p>
    Asoh Black! is one of F.A.M\$' prominent musical artists. He's had a passion
    for hip-hop since high school when he discovered artists like Kanye West,
    Big Sean, and many more. Despite living in a household that didn't celebrate this music, Asoh
    developed a knack for writing lyrics and crafting feel-good records.

    In June 2015, he released his debut EP "20 | 20,” and has since been
    following his vision with the hopes of inspiring others to do the same. Asoh
    was named one of Plug Society’s “50 Artists to Watch in 2017,” and has been
    featured in publications like Lyrical Lemonade. Look out for this hungry
    hitmaker.
